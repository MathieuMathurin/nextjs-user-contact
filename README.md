This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
> npm install
> npm run dev
# or
> yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Authentication

The application uses Github as a OAuth identity provider. Be sure to have a valid Github account to be able to interact with the application.

## What's missing
- Units tests
- Branded Sign in page
- Better error handling
- Empty states
- Translations
- Secrets management

## Mocked API

The http calls are mocked using [Mirage](https://miragejs.com/) which is running a server alongside the frontend application.

There are 5 routes being mocked by Mirage.
